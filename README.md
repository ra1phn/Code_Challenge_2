## ü•≥ Event Guest List Manager

This project is a dynamic web app built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that allows you to manage an event guest list in real-time ‚Äî all without page refreshes.

---

### Learning Goals

- Build a fully interactive guest list manager
- Use `event.preventDefault()` to stop page reload on form submission
- Update the DOM dynamically with JavaScript
- Structure code using HTML, CSS, and JS best practices

---

| File          | Purpose                              |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `index.html`  | Basic HTML layout                    |

###  Testing Strategy

Manual browser testing was used to confirm functionality:
- Console logging during development
- Input validations
- Limit checks
- Edge cases (empty input, editing while full, etc.)

---

###  Stretch Features Completed

- Categorize guests by type (Friend, Family, Colleague)
- Display time of guest addition
- Edit button for guest names
- Remaining slots counter (starts at 1, not 0)
- Disabled form when limit is hit
- Stylish, responsive design
