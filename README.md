## 🥳 Event Guest List Manager

This project is a dynamic web app built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that allows you to manage an event guest list in real-time — all without page refreshes.

---

### Learning Goals

- Build a fully interactive guest list manager
- Use `event.preventDefault()` to stop page reload on form submission
- Update the DOM dynamically with JavaScript
- Structure code using HTML, CSS, and JS best practices

---

### App Structure

| File          | Purpose                              |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `index.html`  | Basic HTML layout                    |
| `style.css`   | All custom styling and responsive UI |
| `src/index.js`| JS logic for interactivity           |

### UI & Styling

- Elegant card-style layout using soft blue-themed color palette
- Responsive table-style list with hover effects
- Color-coded guest tags.
- Smooth interactions with buttons and form inputs
- Reduced container height from 373px to 450px width while keeping a clean aspect ratio

###  Testing Strategy

Manual browser testing was used to confirm functionality:
- Console logging during development
- Input validations
- Limit checks
- Edge cases (empty input, editing while full, etc.)

---

###  Stretch Features Completed

- Categorize guests by type (Friend, Family, Colleague)
- Display time of guest addition
- Edit button for guest names
- Remaining slots counter (starts at 1, not 0)
